    <h3>Dear Hiring Team,</h3>
    <p>
      This letter is to express my interest in becoming a Frontend Developer at Hennge.
      <br>
      After researching Hennge (from Youtube videos, to Github repos and MTS reports), I believe its values were very clear and deeply resonated with me.
      I feel like my own experiences embody <strong>eating unripe fruit</strong> and I'd like to highlight a few of them:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Using Nativescript Vue:</strong>
        Back in 2018 I was an enthusiastic fan of Vue, but completely inexperienced with mobile development.
        So when my team and I decided to create a mobile application during the NASA Space Apps Hackathon I knew it was time to check out Nativescript Vue.
        While Nativescript proved to be a pain to maintain after a few months (and was later discarded in favor of Flutter), the initial 48 hours I spent with it were great!
        My previous Vue knowledge gave me a very substantial advantage and was the only reason why I could deliver an app in a weekend without any previous experience.
        So it definitely served its purpose, even though it was not mature enough for more than a PoC.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Strassen tech stack:</strong>
        In 2020 I started Strassen, one of my pet projects to learn new tech.
        There were many different iterations both on the frontend and backend of the application, these were:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Backend:</strong>
            From <strong>TypeORM + TypeGraphQL</strong>, to <strong>Strapi</strong> and finally arriving at <strong>Prisma + Nexus GraphQL</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Frontend:</strong>
            From <strong>Vue 2 + TS + Apollo</strong> to <strong>Vue 3 + TS + Villus</strong>. (I had to abandon Apollo since it did not support Vue 3 back when I migrated the codebase)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    On both experiences it would've been faster to arrive at the final solutions on my first try.
    But if that was the case, I wouldn't have learned so much about the previous ways.
    <br>
    With this in mind, I believe I share a love for new challenges and exploration with the company, and I'm confident I would be a great fit.
    <br>
    <br>
    Sincerely,
    <br>
    Thales Agapito.
